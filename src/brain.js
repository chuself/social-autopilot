Open by signalling which part it is, and end by pointing at the next one.

${note}

- "headline": max 60 characters. One concrete idea. No colons, no hype words.
- "body": 15-30 words expanding the headline. Plain, specific.
- "cta": 2-4 words (e.g. "See it work", "Book a demo").
- "caption": 40-90 words for the post itself. Opens with a hook a hotelier would recognise.
  Do NOT include any URL or phone number — the link is appended automatically.
  Line breaks allowed. At most one emoji, only if it genuinely helps.
- "hashtags": array of 3-5 hashtags, relevant, no spam.
- "imagePrompt": a background description in THIS WEEK'S visual direction:
  «${look?.imageStyle ?? "dark abstract texture"}»
  Stay inside that direction — vary the subject, not the style. MUST specify
  "no text, no people, no logos" and a dark colour grade.
  The headline is laid over the left side, so keep the subject right-of-centre
  and low contrast there.
- "template": "spotlight"
