  Ends with ${brand.site}. Line breaks allowed. At most one emoji, only if it genuinely helps.
- "hashtags": array of 3-5 hashtags, relevant, no spam.
- "imagePrompt": a photographic or abstract background description. MUST specify
  "no text, no people, no logos" and a dark ${brand.colors.primary}/${brand.colors.teal} colour grade.
  The headline is laid over the left side, so keep the subject right-of-centre and low contrast.
- "template": "spotlight"
